            Procedures For <a>Living Donor</a> and <a>Deceased Donor</a></h2>
            <br>
            <b>For Living Donor:</b><br>
            <ol>
                <li>The living donor needs to undergo some medical tests and evaluations to check and confirm her/his her medical compatibility with the recipient.</li>

                <li>The living donor's medical compatibility is confirmed by a doctor. Only after all the tests have positively confirmed that the donor is compatible with the recipient, can the transplant take place.</li>
                
                <li>The living donor’s organs are retrieved surgically by doctors. They will be stored in special chemical solutions briefly until they are transplanted into the recipient.</li>

                <li>The living donor will need to remain under medical care for a few days or weeks after organ retrieval until she/he is fit to go home.</li>
            </ol><br><br><br>

            <b>For Deceased Donor:</b><br>
            <ol>
                <li>A deceased donor is often someone who has suffered a fatal injury to the head or had Brain Haemorrhage. She/He is declared brain stem dead by a group of medical experts in a hospital.</li>

                <li>The donor's family has to give consent for the donation before the process of organ retrieval can be carried out. Meanwhile, the donor is kept on life-support with Doctors looking after all her/his needs until the retrieval of the organs is allowed to move forward.</li>
                
                <li>Suitable recipients for all the organs are identified from a waiting list. They are notified and asked to reach their respective hospitals.</li>

                <li>After retrieval, the body of the donor is respectfully handed over to the family.</li>
